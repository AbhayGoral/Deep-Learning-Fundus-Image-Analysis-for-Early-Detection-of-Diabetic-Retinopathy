# Deep-Learning-Fundus-Image-Analysis-for-Early-Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy
This project is a Deep Learning–based web application for the early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using retinal fundus images. It uses a pre-trained Xception CNN model to classify retinal images and provides predictions through a simple Flask web interface.
